1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?

A regular expression, or regex as it is often referred to, is a pattern that describes a certain amount of text or sequencing of bytes or characters. it could include a letters, digits, dots, underscores, percentage signs, hyphens, and escaped literals. A regex engine is a piece fo software the can process regular expressions and which tries to match the pattern to a given string. Regex engines are typically only invoekd when needed to ensure it's run at the right time of for the right purpose.

2. What is an array and how does it work?

An array is one of the most basic types of data structures. Although one of the most basic, ther is actually a lot going on under the hood in any programming language. An array is basically a data structure designed to hold a group of objects (either of the same or of different types). When an array is created, it's length is set (although it can be changed--usually doubled--as items are added to the array). An item, or element, is accessed through an index which starts at zero. Arrays can be copied, cloned, searched, sorted, and items cab be inserted into or deleted from arrays. Of course, there is code under the hood or programming languanges to make all of this happen.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?

A hash table is a data structure that allows you to keep a list of key-value pairs. it's used to quickly store and retrive data. Since computers work better with numbers than strings, a hash function can take a set of numbers or a string and run it through an algorithm, called a hash function, to create an identifier--which then servers as the index in an array where the key-value pair is stored. Sometimes a hash function will produce the same hash (or index) as another item called collisions. In such cases, whoever programs the hash table will need to account for a way to solve collisions (there are multiple techniques).
